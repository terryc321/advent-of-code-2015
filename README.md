* Advent of code 2015

** Coupling


solutions in multiple languages

at moment haskell simply doing map f xs , with adder possibly
nothing more complicated

how coupled do want haskell code to be regards complete build system ?
can we do everything from scratch on each problem ?
using no inherit capabilities ?

lets get the solutions in haskell code first round
then figure out if we can improve the solutions , perhaps
