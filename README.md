* Advent of code 2015

** Haskell libraries 
using cabal able to use MD5 implementation , first major breakthrough using haskell
as of yet , still just using haskell like "poking the bear" 

** Coupling

solutions in multiple languages

at moment haskell simply doing map f xs , with adder possibly
nothing more complicated

how coupled do want haskell code to be regards complete build system ?
can we do everything from scratch on each problem ?
using no inherit capabilities ?

lets get the solutions in haskell code first round
then figure out if we can improve the solutions , perhaps

** Guile , Chicken scheme

both require their own flavour of scheme 
is it possible to build a common infra-structure like slib 
whatever happened to slib anyway ?
