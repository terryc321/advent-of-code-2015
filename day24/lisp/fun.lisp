what is the set of 6 numbers from a list that is the lowest possible
given remaining numbers is it possible to

setA
setB
setC

three sets of numbers have to add to same value
prodA  a1 a2 a3
prodB  b1 b2 b3 ... bN
prodC  c1 c2 c3 ....       cN

set with fewest elements 

inp = [ 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11 ] 

puz =  [1 , 3 , 5  ,11 , 13,  17,  19,  23 , 29 , 31 , 41 , 43,
       47  ,53,  59,  61,  67,  71,  73 , 79  ,83,  89 , 97 , 101,
       103 , 107,  109,  113 ]

suppose i take A numbers from a given starting list , their sum is target T for other numbers
now two sets B C also sum to target T
so sum sets B union C is 2 T
if
